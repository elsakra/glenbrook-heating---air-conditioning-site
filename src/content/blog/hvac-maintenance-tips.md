# Essential HVAC Maintenance Tips for Homeowners

Proper HVAC maintenance is crucial for keeping your home comfortable year-round while minimizing energy costs and preventing costly repairs. Here are our top maintenance tips to help you get the most out of your heating and cooling system.

## Regular Filter Changes

One of the simplest yet most important maintenance tasks is changing your air filter regularly. A dirty filter restricts airflow, forcing your system to work harder and consume more energy.

- **Standard filters**: Replace every 1-3 months
- **High-efficiency filters**: Replace every 3-6 months
- **Homes with pets**: Replace more frequently

## Keep Your Outdoor Unit Clean

Your outdoor condenser unit needs proper airflow to operate efficiently:

- Remove debris, leaves, and grass clippings
- Trim vegetation to maintain 2-3 feet of clearance
- Gently clean the fins with a garden hose
- Never use a pressure washer on the unit

## Schedule Professional Maintenance

While homeowners can handle basic maintenance, professional tune-ups are essential:

- **Spring**: Prepare your AC for summer
- **Fall**: Get your heating system ready for winter
- Professional technicians can identify potential issues early
- Regular maintenance extends equipment life and maintains warranty coverage

## Monitor Your Thermostat

Optimize your thermostat settings for comfort and efficiency:

- Use programmable or smart thermostats
- Set temperatures 7-10 degrees different when away
- Avoid frequent temperature changes
- Consider upgrading to a smart thermostat for better control

## Check and Clean Vents

Ensure proper airflow throughout your home:

- Keep vents and registers unobstructed
- Vacuum vents regularly to remove dust buildup
- Check for damaged or disconnected ductwork
- Consider professional duct cleaning every 3-5 years
